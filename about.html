 <h3 class="capitalized bottom-low">A little about me</h3>


  <p id="my-description"> I am currently pursuing FT opportunities in healthcare and social service research, strategy, and innovation for early
    Summer 2017, when I complete my Master of Design at the IIT Institute of Design. I am passionate about understanding
    and improving complex human systems through structured research, analysis and generative synthesis. I am focused on problems
    related to global disparities in healthcare and education.

 <h3 class="capitalized bottom-low">A little bit more</h3>

  <p id="my-description"> I studied Psychology and Latin American Studies as an undergraduate at Kenyon College then traveled to Mendoza, Argentina
    on a year-long <a href="https://www.profellow.com/3-questions/fulbright-english-teaching-assistantships-3-questions-with-jenni-schneiderman/">Fulbright Fellowship</a>    to teach English and conduct human rights research. My Fulbright year encouraged me to ask "big picture" questions about
    the role of education in shaping and reinforcing societal values. At that moment, my career took an intentional pivot
    away from clinical psychology and towards macro systems of adaptive human development. This brought me to the Chicago
    Public School System where I pioneered and developed after-school, summer, and community engagement programming at the
    <a href="http://www.agcchicago.org">Academy for Global Citizenship</a>. With the intention to increase my impact potential,
    I decided to pursue my Master of Design at IIT's Institute of Design (ID) in Chicago. I focus my courses and client work
    on research, strategy and service design.
